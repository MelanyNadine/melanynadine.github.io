        Hi there! This is the space a created
        myself to share some stuff with the world. As you might already know if you personally
        know me, I'm a person with several interests,
        most of them related to STEM field.<br>
        I assume you noticed the dark tone of the page; I always use black, and I do like rock music along with some pop artist, like Sia or Imagine Dragons. My favourite musical genres are Deathrock, New Wave and Darkwave though.
      </p>

      <h2>A bit about my background</h2>

      <p>
        I'm based in Quito-Ecuador. This is a beautiful and
        diverse country where people use to be gentile. not
        to mention how beautiful landscapes are. <br>
          I love learning, so throughout the years I've been dedicated myself to learn a lot of stuff. Among those things are programming, languages, history, economics, psychology, chemistry and some other STEM disciplines.<br>
          I'm majoring in physics and despite I've found this career tremendously challenging I've also found it beautiful. Ironically I started learning programming due to the fact that it is mandatory in the discipline; prior to the journey I didn't even know how to handle Windows OS properly.

          I speak Spanish, English, Portuguese, German, French, and Italian (the
        order is how proficient I am in each of them, from C2 to A1). My goal is to speak at least ten languages before I reach 35 and following that purpose I'm currently taking my French and Italian to the next level and learning Hebrew and Arabic. If you need to contact me, feel free to do it in your native language if listed.
      </p>

		  <h2>About this, my little space</h2>

      <p>Since I've created this to share some stuff (mine and some other things I consider everybody should have access to), you'll find here some articles, projects, readings and some art of mine that I've worked on since teen. If you have questions regarding the content hereby provided, don't hesitate to contact me. <br>
        Welcome to my little space :)
